<ul>
<li><b>Start small</b>. Review and understand the existing source code. Spend some time beforehand running the examples and making sure you understand how they work. You should have a general idea 
of how your change would affect the rest of the source and whether your issue would benefit the goals of the project. Some additional thoughts might be:

<ul>
<li>Is the issue a duplicate of an existing bug? Search the issue tracker to identify whether the issue is unique.</li>
<li>Does this feature exist or would this produce new functionality? Ask around on the mailing list.</li>
<li>Will this feature be useful to the project?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Be explanatory</b>, explain why this feature would be useful to the project. You could provide high level diagrams, descriptions, and code examples that demonstrate its value.

<li>Write an automated test to accompany your patch</ul>
<ul>
<li>Providing automated tests help developers test and confirm that your patch does what it says it should do.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Be open to suggestions</b> and to other ways of accomplishing what you're aiming for. Be collaborative, friendly and respectful. Acknowledge the effort others put in.</li>
<li><b>Be persistent</b>. If you don't get any response right away, don't necessarily give up. If you're still convinced your idea has merit, find another way to present it. Request another developer - ideally, one  familiar with your work - to take the time to review your contrinbution.</li>
<li><b>Be responsive</b> to suggestions, requests, or issues raised. Revise your work accordingly.</li>

<li>If some time has gone by, update your changes to work with the current CVS version.</li>
</ul>


First you should identify an existing bug/issue with the codebase.
* make sure that your issue is not a duplicate of another issue in the system
